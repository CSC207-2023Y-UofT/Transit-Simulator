# Transit-system-tracker #

This program is a (mock) transit system tracker that has offers many functions to a user, from directions and local 
train schedules to the average customer, as well as offering statistics to the 'local' transit company who 'made' the 
program.

This program is :
- Coded mostly in Java (and maybe later, Kotlin)
- A demonstration of clean architecture in programming.

Some features that would hopefully be implemented in the future: 
- The program


## Examples ##

- A customer wants to go from point A to point B; this program would provide information like train schedules, ETAs, 
directions and more from the 'local' transit system.
- The 'local' transit company would like to see some statistics; this program would show how many passengers purchased 
tickets on a given day, train capacities during specific times, analytics, etc.
