# Transit Simulator #

This program is a (mock) transit system simulator that offers many functions to the user, from directions and local 
model schedules to the average customer, as well as providing statistics.

This program is:
- A group project for CSC207 in Summer 2023 @ UofT.
- Made with Java.
- A demonstration of Clean Architecture and design patterns in programming.
- Licensed under the terms of the provided MIT license.

## Examples ##

- A customer wants to go from point A to point B; this program would provide information like model schedules, ETAs, 
directions and more from the 'local' transit system.
- The 'local' transit company would like to see some statistics; this program would show how many passengers purchased 
tickets on a given day, model capacities during specific times, analytics, etc.
- The company would like to modify the railway and management system such as stations, tracks, ticket prices, and employment.

## Features ##
As a customer:
- Simulate the Toronto Subway System with realtime movement updates.
- Click on stations to see predicted arrival times in a specific direction.
- Simulate buying train tickets. Select from different ticket types and see their valid use time.

As staff:
- Record statistics and display them in graphs that update in realtime.
- Manage, add and remove staff across the system.
- View which staff are working on which trains, their staff types, names, numbers.
